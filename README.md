# My-First-Html-Project
This is my first HTML project, where I created a simple Personal Profile Web Page using only basic HTML. The purpose of this project is to introduce myself on a web page and practice the fundamental structure of a website.  The webpage includes different sections that describe who I am, what I like, and how people can connect with me online.
